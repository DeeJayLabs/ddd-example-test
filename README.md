# Silex ddd example test
This is a sandbox or an application to get the concepts of the [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), and to try
some of the concepts and understand all the basic functionament.

To avoid the big bootstraping and include some extra libraries that can make some extra noise the base is [silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
a microframework that add the basic functionallity.

All that you need is in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), that it's a nginx, php and mysql.

# Extra libraries
To make things a little easy, some libraries are added:

* twig/twig
* ramsey
* doctrine
* dflydev/doctrine-orm-service-provider
* symfony/doctrine
* symfony/yaml
* symfony/twig-bridge
